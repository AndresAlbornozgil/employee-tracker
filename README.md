# Employee Tracker

## Description
A command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. My motivation in building this project was to create interface that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. I learned that databases are nothing but fancy excell sheets and that it's very important to keep in mind how data relates to other data.

## Installation
This project does not require an installation. However, you are welcome to to either clone the repository and access the project files or fork the repo.

## Usage
In order to use this application, first you must open the project in your code editor and start the terminal. Once in the terminal, you must type "node index.js" and then you will be prompted with a series of questions. The questions are very clear and simple to understand, so just follow along in order to interact with the database.
